🕶️ Hi! I'm building Large Language Model (LLM) agents to help businesses scale at [AgentScale.ai](https://agentscale.ai). Every day, I'm learning about product, sales and founding a startup.

🎓 I graduated in CS from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) in 2023, with both software engineering and AI research experience. I achieved 3 Top Project awards for my AI classes in CS3244 Machine Learning, CS4243 Computer Vision and CS4246 AI Planning & Decision Making.

💼 Previously, I worked as:
- Data Scientist Intern at Indeed (2022) - Improved the core recommendation system for >300M job seekers, by deploying a model improvement to production using the big data stack (e.g. Spark, Hive, Airflow).
- RL Research Student at NUS (2021) - Researched transformer architectures and reinforcement learning for >2 years, with a survey paper on representation learning for reinforcement learning.
- Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Grab (2021)

🧠 I run [AI Space](https://t.me/joinchat/Nd3pOKrmU2EwYTU9), an AI community in Singapore with 600+ people, e.g. at Google Developer Space. Previously, I led the [NUS Statistics & Data Science Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nussds) as president, organizing data science workshops and competitions.
