üï∂Ô∏è Hi! I'm building Large Language Model (LLM) agents to help businesses scale at [AgentScale.ai](https://agentscale.ai).

üéì I graduated in CS from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) in 2023, with both software engineering and AI research experience.

üíº I previously worked as:
- Data Scientist Intern at Indeed (2022): Match Recommendation Platform
- Student AI Researcher at NUS (2021): Transformers + Reinforcement Learning
- Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Grab (2021)

üíª I've worked on multiple projects:
- Polypeptide Embedding Search (LLM4Bio Hackathon USD$1000)
- Multi-agent World Models (CS4246 Top Project)
- Doodle-based Image Search (CS4243 Top Project)
- Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (CS3244 Top Project)
- Multi-agent RL Game (iNTUition Hackathon Best AI Hack)
- Data Visualization on Climate Change (IPUR Optigram Competition)
- Social Media Product Analytics (HackAsia Global Hackathon Finalist)

üß† I run [AI Space](https://t.me/joinchat/Nd3pOKrmU2EwYTU9), an AI community in Singapore with 600+ people, e.g. at Google Developer Space. I previously led the [NUS Statistics & Data Science Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nussds) as president, organizing data science workshops and competitions.
