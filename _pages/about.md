💻 Hi! I’m a computer science fresh grad from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), Turing Research Programme and University Scholars Programme.

🕶️ I'm currently building Large Language Model (LLM) agents to scale business processes at [AgentScale.ai](https://agentscale.ai).

💼 I previously worked as:
- Data Scientist Intern at Indeed (2022)
- RL Research Student at NUS (2021)
- Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Grab (2021)

🧠 I run [AI Space](https://t.me/joinchat/Nd3pOKrmU2EwYTU9), an AI community in Singapore with 500+ people, to meet new people with similar interests in AI. Previously, I led the [NUS Statistics & Data Science Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nussds) student club as president.
