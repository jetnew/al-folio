🕶️ Hi! I'm building Large Language Model (LLM) agents to help businesses scale at [AgentScale.ai](https://agentscale.ai).

🎓 I graduated in CS from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) in 2023, with both ML engineering and AI research experience.

💼 I previously worked as:
- Data Scientist Intern at Indeed (2022)
- Student AI Researcher at NUS (2021)
- Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Grab (2021)

🧠 I run [AI Space](https://t.me/joinchat/Nd3pOKrmU2EwYTU9), an AI community in Singapore with 600+ people, e.g. at Google Developer Space.
