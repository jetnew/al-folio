💻 Hi! I'm a computer science undergraduate at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg).

🧠 I'm currently researching world models for multi-agent reinforcement learning for my final year project.

♟️ I like to play games, make games, and make AI play games. In the future: [Make AI that build games, then play them?](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/03/paired-new-multi-agent-approach-for.html)
