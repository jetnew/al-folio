### About AgentScale AI

[AgentScale AI](https://agentscale.ai/) is building an AI agent for the browser. A [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) takes in text as input and generates text as output. In contrast, a LLM agent for the browser takes in the website’s DOM (e.g. HTML) as input and generates browser actions (e.g. clicking and typing) as output.

Our vision is to champion a new era of web productivity with an AI agent that simplifies and accelerates online tasks. Our mission is to empower people to focus on meaningful work by eliminating tedious tasks.

I am [Jet New](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jetnew/), AI engineer and founder of AgentScale AI. Previously, I worked as a data scientist at Indeed, ML engineer at Grab, and did AI research at NUS. My passion has always been in automation, leading me to create scripts for games and research reinforcement learning (used in AlphaStar, AlphaGo).

AgentScale AI’s founding journey began 7 months ago in June. This post lists the most significant of my experiences in each month in the past year, shaping my approach to starting a startup. Each section is led by a quote memorable to me, and details my thoughts around each theme. I would love to hear your thoughts too!

### June: “Is this really what you want to do?”

At the start of the year with the release of ChatGPT (GPT-4), tons of LLM apps like chatbots for customer service and chatting with PDFs went viral and successful on Twitter, to the point that people began coining them “AI wrappers”, describing products that simply wrap over ChatGPT’s capabilities. It must be a good direction to start with though, I thought, and weeks later I pitched to potential business partners.

Little did I realize, I was more excited sharing about the potential of AI agents than the LLM apps that I was pitching. One seasoned director asked me “Is this really what you want to work on?” He sensed my passion was greater elsewhere. I had simply followed the trend of what seemed to work, instead of figuring out what I should work on. How do founders decide what they should work on? At least, it was not by chasing whatever was trendy at the time.

### July: “For our loved ones”

At a [LLM hackathon (on a yacht!)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jetnew_happy-to-share-that-my-team-won-1000-activity-7091648720160657408-SqVe), scientist-entrepreneur Jonathan Rothberg, the owner of the yacht, gave a speech to participants and invited investors. Years ago, his son was sent to the ICU and doctors didn’t have a rapid test to test for an inherited disease. Frustrated, he brought to market a machine for massively parallel DNA sequencing.

In his founder’s story, he shared his “why” - to make no regrets when it came to our loved ones. His mission resonated with me and many others. A strong purpose is key to forge through in pursuit of a vision. For Jonathan, he chose what to work on for his loved ones.

### August: “Work on cool stuff”

A lot is written about how to come up with good ideas or evaluate ideas, but not on figuring out what you actually *want* to work on for the next few years. The latter question is much more personal. What gets *you* out of bed in the morning?

[Pebblely](https://pebblely.com/)’s co-founders Swee Kiat and Alfred decided with “At a party, will I be excited to tell others what I’m working on?” Some on Twitter proposed “If AGI is the most important problem of our lifetime, we must work on it” Others were simply concerned about profitability and whether they could build it.

I decided that I want to “work on cool stuff”. I want to build stuff that I’m excited to share with the world, stuff that is impactful, useful and awesome. I decided to work on AI agents and built [Personal Assistant](https://agentscale.ai/assistant), an AI on Telegram that integrates with your personal services such as Gmail and Calendar. It was a cool product that I was proud of building, and I even acquired 2 customers.

### September: “Today, Bard integrates with your Google services”

![Google Bard’s Extensions announcement, allowing Bard to integrate with Google services.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fc7b2cf6-ba00-40fa-9fb9-f7bc38a201db/ce2721f4-5454-4b67-95cd-4bd3297f6142/bard_extensions.webp)

Google Bard’s Extensions announcement, allowing Bard to integrate with Google services.

In this age of accelerating innovation, it is unsurprising for disruptions to happen every month. However, [when Bard announced Extensions](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-new-features-update-sept-2023/), allowing Bard to connect with Gmail and Drive, it dawned on me the difficulty of entering a competitive market with giant incumbents and their strategic advantages.

[Jenni AI](https://jenni.ai/)’s co-founders David and Henry’s answer was to niche - from a general writing tool to academic-style writing. Pebblely niched into product photos at a time of already-high competition in the image generation space. Kaspar of [Forge Ventures](https://www.forge.vc/) agreed, sharing [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) as a model example.

At first, I was dissatisfied due to a dilemma: Isn’t the specialty of AI was that it can be applied to many applications at once? Marcus of [Polyworks Production](https://www.polyworksproduction.com/) and Leonard of [Voltade](https://voltade.com/) agreed with generality over narrowness.

I finally reached a resolution in an [essay by Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html): “You don’t need the narrowness of the [niche] per se. It’s depth you need; you get narrowness a byproduct of optimizing for depth.” A niche was never about narrowness but about *specialization* - to be the best solution in a problem space.

### October: “I might invest in this one”

While product-market fit is important, founder-market fit is even more so. Why are you the best person to work on this problem? Skills, experience, insights, network and resources are relevant, but the founder’s story - one’s “why” - is ultimately what compels founder-market fit, to others but more importantly to oneself.

![Sharing about AgentScale AI with other AI founders and investors at the mixer.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fc7b2cf6-ba00-40fa-9fb9-f7bc38a201db/f1ec130b-dd24-491b-9b31-ecc62e7c5b11/Untitled.png)

Sharing about AgentScale AI with other AI founders and investors at the mixer.

At an [AI Founders and Investors Mixer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaimeng_ai-hacklaunch-innovation-activity-7123657383423201280-YLl_), I pitched my product demo - an AI agent on the browser - and the story behind it, and soon interested founders and investors formed a group around me. One investor even remarked “I might invest in this one”. While I was not raising a round at the time, it was validation that the founder’s story is essential to inspire a vision.

### November: “I’ll continue working on this myself for now”

I’ve been open to finding a business co-founder. As Y Combinator advises, having a co-founder is needed not just for complementary skillsets but also for moral support. Having made a lot of progress on side projects with Gene, my good friend from university, he could be a good co-founder. How do founders choose their co-founders?

[The Founder’s Dilemmas](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691158303/the-founders-dilemmas) scopes the landscape well, considering resources (expertise, network, finances), working styles (solo vs collaborative), roles (CEO vs CTO), relationships (friends vs co-workers) and rewards (equity vs cash) in the founding team.

I’d pitched the vision to Gene and got both of us excited to get started. However, after thoroughly discussing with Gene, including exploring alternatives, I determined that a full-time co-founder with skin in the game was important to me, but Gene was unable to commit full-time without proven revenue that can replace his current pay. In the end, while I made the difficult decision to continue working on this myself for now, I believe it was a necessary one to make.

### December: “It fits a time-saving use case, well done”

As I observed how people around me used ChatGPT, many complained of ChatGPT either misunderstanding their message or hallucinating made-up information. However, I noticed that the majority of their messages and their intents can actually be inferred by reading the tabs open on their browser.

![Browser Extension, a Chrome/Edge extension that integrates ChatGPT directly into your browser.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fc7b2cf6-ba00-40fa-9fb9-f7bc38a201db/af58a0b3-7245-4e21-ba25-55900eac2be4/Screenshot_2024-01-04_at_5.19.03_PM.png)

Browser Extension, a Chrome/Edge extension that integrates ChatGPT directly into your browser.

Therefore, I built a [extension for ChatGPT](https://agentscale.ai/extension) to access and read tabs on the browser. As expected, most misunderstandings and hallucinations in practice were eliminated, resulting in high quality responses from ChatGPT. I acquired 2 customers for this product who were compelled by the product’s value proposition, one of whom complimented “It fits a time-saving use case, well done”.

### Some Milestones

From June to December, I’ve focused solely on learning product development and startup foundations without concerning about sales or distribution.

I’ve iterated over 10 different ideas, to varying stages of execution:

1. Customer Service Chatbot (MVP)
2. HR Training Platform (MVP)
3. [Distilled Daily: AI Newsletter](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jetnew_distilled-daily-activity-7073872540305141760-8_PJ) (Social Launch)

### Directions Ahead

Having validated products with paying customers, the next step is sales and distribution. Therefore, the focus for 2024 is to develop and execute a Go-to-Market strategy.

In 2024, AI agents that control the browser will become sufficiently reliable for many online tasks. Our goal is to streamline online research for analysts and researchers in Singapore, [beginning with the manual task of data extraction](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jetnew_spending-hours-on-manual-and-tedious-data-activity-7143482720403218432-XNUu).
